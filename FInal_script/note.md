Your method of calculating train MSE and val MSE in running_tf+specdp.py is correct and standard for PyTorch training loops:

Train MSE:
You accumulate the loss for each batch, multiply by the batch size, sum over all batches, and divide by the total number of samples.
This gives the true mean squared error over the entire training set for that epoch.

Val MSE:
You do the same for the validation set, in evaluation mode and with torch.no_grad().

This is the standard and correct way to compute epoch-level MSE in deep learning frameworks.

The Other Script (running_tf_dp_adv (1).py)
In running_tf_dp_adv (1).py, you do the same thing inside the training and validation loops.
However, after the training and validation loops, you also do this:

This recomputes the train and val MSE by running another full pass over the datasets, even though you already computed them in the main loops.
This is redundant and wastes computation.
It is not more accurate, unless you are doing something different in the main loop (e.g., using dropout or batchnorm in training mode, which you are not here).

Which is more accurate?
Both methods are accurate if you use model.eval() and torch.no_grad() for validation.
Your method is more efficient, as it does not repeat the computation.
The other script's extra pass is not necessary and does not improve accuracy, unless you want to measure MSE with the model in a specific mode (e.g., always in eval mode).


1. Remove the extra full-dataset MSE computation
Delete or comment out these lines inside the validation block:



        train_mse = sum(criterion(model(xc.to(device), xt.to(device)), y.to(device)).item()*y.size(0)
                        for xc,xt,y in train_loader)/dataset_size
        val_mse   = sum(criterion(model(xc.to(device), xt.to(device)), y.to(device)).item()*y.size(0)
                        for xc,xt,y in val_loader)/len(val_loader.dataset)


2. Use the accumulated losses as your MSEs
After the training and validation loops, use the already accumulated tloss and vloss as your train and val MSE:
    # ...existing code...
    tloss /= len(train_loader.dataset)
    # ...existing code...
    vloss /= len(val_loader.dataset)
    # ...existing code...

    print(f"Train MSE: {tloss:.4f} | Val MSE: {vloss:.4f} | Ïƒ={sigma:.3f} | C={MAX_GRAD_NORM:.3f}\nTime: {h}hrs. {m}min. {s}sec.")

    # ...existing code...
    if vloss < best_val:
        best_val = vloss; no_improve = 0; torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'best_dp_model_adaptive_largeralpha.pt')
        print(f"Model saved with val loss: {best_val}")
    else:
        # ...existing code...





Yes, it is **correct** that there is **no `loss.backward()` in the `dp_sgd` branch** of your code.

**Reason:**  
In DP-SGD, you manually compute per-sample gradients using `autograd.grad` for each sample in the batch, clip and sum them, add noise, and then assign the result to each parameter's `.grad`.  
The usual `loss.backward()` is not needed (and should not be used) here, because:
- `loss.backward()` would accumulate the batch gradient, not per-sample gradients.
- You are setting `.grad` manually after your custom DP-SGD logic.

**Summary:**  
Your implementation is correct for DP-SGD. No need for `loss.backward()` in this branch.
